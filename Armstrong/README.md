# Armstrong Numbers

An  Armstrong number of *n* digits is an integer such that the sum of its digits each one to the power of *n* is equal to the number itself.

For example, 8208 is an Armstrong number as

$$8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4 = 8208$$

All 1-digit numbers are Armstrong numbers.

Write program that reads a sequence of numbers, one number per line, from the file `numbers.txt`; and:
1) Prints the number of armstrong number found on `numbers.txt` to the terminal.
2) Prints the armstrong numbers to the terminal.
